# Following a Angular-to-web-component guide found at
[This url](https://buddy.works/tutorials/building-web-components-with-angular)
This project builds and bundles a simple Angular-generated web-component that fetches and display news articles from an API.

After running `npm run build:component` a widget folder can be found at dist/. That js-file can be referenced in any project and included using `<news-widget />`;

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.0.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
